A ruby tool to crawl laws from the former ec.europa.eu/prelex

This is the final outcome of a project I did for the chair "Politik und Regieren in Deutschland und Europa" at University of Potsdam.

It crawls ec.europa.eu/prelex for some types of laws and extracts specific details from the pages.

The result is then saved to CSV. It also has a GUI.

The tool will most probably not work anymore, since many years have passed and the website has (apparently) changed.
